# Advanced Concepts In Web Production Assignment

Production Version: http://jamesrwilliams.github.io/acwp

## The Project Brief

"Your task is to investigate a web technology that you feel is ‘waiting in the wings’ to be exploited either by your own company or an organisation who is a client of your company. You should then make a ‘multimedia presentational pitch’ (10 mins max to include time for formative feedback) designed to persuade budget holders that it is worth investing in implementing this technology for a specified purpose. This should be in a format that could be hosted easily on an intranet so that others in the company could view it and there should be enough textual explanation/animation/audio so that the pitch is easily understandable by someone who was not at the physical presentation session (eg: the External Examiner). The final presentation should be hosted on the Projects server so make sure you apply for space in good time."
